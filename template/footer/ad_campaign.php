     <h3>Q1. Are you a brick-and-mortar business or an online business? </h3>
     <p>
       If you are a brick-and-mortar business, the best way to advertise your business is either through Social Media Advertising or Direct Mail Marketing. In the modern age, consumers are increasingly becoming reliant on social media to stay up to date with the latest news and trends, so having a large presence on social media sites and apps will perfectly advertise your business. Those individuals who don’t regularly utilize social media apps can also be targeted by mailing ads directly to their addresses.
     </p>
     <p>
       If you are an online business, the best way to advertise your business is either through Social Media Advertising or Search Engine Advertising. There are thousands of online companies that sell products or services that can potentially be very similar to your products or services so you need to get the attention of online consumers in areas where they are most likely to be, social media and search engines.
     </p>
     <h3>Q1a. Is your business in a rural or densely-populated area? </h3>
<p>
  If it’s in a rural area, advertising with social media can really help establish an online presence.

If it’s in a densely-populated area, Direct Mail Advertising and Ambient Marketing can help you stand out in the crowd.


</p>
<h3>Q2. Did you see any additional profit from last month due to advertising?	Y / N

</h3>
<p>
  If yes, what can you do to improve upon your marketing strategy? Ex. Display ads that target different demographics

If no, list out where the shortcomings in your advertising strategy may come from.
</p>
<h3>Q3. What was the difference in your average visitors per day from last month? Last year? </h3>
<p>
  If your average visitors per day has been stagnant or steadily declines over the months, consider changing your advertising strategies.
</p>
<p>
  If your average visitors per day has been rising, continue to implement the same tactics, but keep in mind that this rise in visitors is not permanent. You should be still seeking ways to improve your strategies.
</p>
<h3>Q4. What demographics primarily frequent your business?  </h3>
<p>
  If your business attracts a certain demographic i.e. the elderly or females, consider targeting your advertisements towards that demographic to increase numbers from that group.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re attempting to target different demographics, change your advertising strategy to include values or ideas that that group is most likely to find appealing. Astroturf Marketing can help you target certain demographics by paying distinct groups of people to positively review your product or service.
</p>
<h3>Q5. How much do you spend on advertising budgets alone?  </h3>
<p>
  If you are spending a large amount of money and are still receiving inadequate results, then change your advertising strategy. Investing a sizable amount of cash into advertising will not necessarily increase your profits. You need to advertise smart and target specific groups of people.
</p>
<p>
  If you are afraid that increasing your advertising expenditure will adversely affect your profits, consider the idea that you need to increase the exposure of business to new clients in order to elevate your profits. Even loyal clients will not stay with you permanently, so always seek new growth.
</p>
<h3>Q6. Where are your advertisements typically located?  </h3>
<p>
  If you are a brick-and-mortar business, location is the most important aspect to any ad. Place the ad in a highly visible or targeted location. You can even increase visibility of your ad in dense areas using Ambient Marketing techniques, where you will associate a product of your business to an everyday object.
</p>
<p>
  If you are online business, don’t just place your ad on a popular website. Consider the demographics for that site and the demographics that frequent your website. Also consider affiliate marketing if you’re trying to maximize the amount of exposure you gain on a certain product or service.
</p>
<h3>Q7. How do you word your advertisements?  </h3>
<p>
  If your advertisements are very wordy, more often than not, that potential customer will simply ignore the advertisement. Consumers are bombarded by hundreds of advertisements daily, and you need to catch their attention before they move on with their life. Get straight to the point with your ad.
</p>
<p>
  You can also improve your ad’s word structure with small and quick jingles or rhymes. They have been proven to persist in the mind of consumers because of how catchy those phrase can be.
</p>
<h3>Q8. How do you visually present you advertisements? Do you use videos and/or images? </h3>
<p>
  If you use videos to advertise your business, consider a Viral Marketing campaign to increase your online and social media presence.
</p>
<p>
  Your advertisements can also be improved by altering the color schemes to invoke different feelings. Purple tones are traditionally provide a sense of elegance and regality while blue tones invoke calming and relaxing thoughts. Try to match the color palette of your ads with what your business stands for.
</p>
<h3>Q9. What message do your advertisements send?  </h3>
<p>
  If you advertisements are too generic, they will be lost in the sea of millions of other ads. Some online businesses frequently use risqué pictures of women to attract the attention of male audiences, utilizing the art of attraction to promote their business.
</p>
<p>
  If your advertisements place an importance on important cultural or political values like family or animal welfare, you can appeal to people’s emotions and promote your business in this way. Ambient Marketing utilizes symbols to advertise a business and can help promote your company while advocating an idea or value.
</p>
<h3>Q10. Do your ads include discounts or coupons?</h3>
<p>
  Ads with discounts or coupons have been proven to attract more customers than ads without those additional components.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you’re an online or brick-and-mortar business, customers are more likely to shop with your business when they know that the price is marked down on a service or product, even if it is only a perceived discount rather than an actual discount. Even if you won’t gain as large of profit when consumers use a coupon to purchase your product, they are still more likely to purchase other items when enter your business or website.
