              <h4>1. I can't see the reminders I set on the calendar! When set up a reminder for a bill I have coming up, I check to see if it successfuly went through by looking at the big calendar, but I don't see anything. How do I know if my reminder was saved?</h4>
              <p>
                -If you set up a bill reminder, you will not see it posted on the calendar. The calendar is simply used for you to visually see dates coming up. Don't worry, if you're reminder was successfully saved, you will get an email sent to you stating "Your bill reminder has been set.".
