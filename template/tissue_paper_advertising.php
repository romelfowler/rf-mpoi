                Tissue-pack marketing, an advertising phenomenon that originates from Japan, is method of marketing that utilizes cheap, useful objects to advertise businesses or products. This style of advertising is based heavily on the concept of passing out flyers to passing pedestrians, but the main difference being that the flyers are replaced altogether with tissue-packs or other small items that advertise businesses and brands.These small items are typically packaged with a printed graphic or visual that promotes a certain brand or product, i.e example. It has been noted that people who receive and use these items are more likely to remember that business or product since they will continually be exposed to the graphics on the packaging when they use the product. Traditionally, these items would be tissue packages advertising a business, but any item can be used during a tissue-pack advertising campaign. Other items to consider in a tissue-pack campaign can be a deck of cards, water bottles, or even condoms. The largest constraint to keep in mind is the cost of production and the value of the product to your target audience. Remember, these consumables are being passed out to consumers free of charge as a way to promote your business. With this in mind, larger or costlier items like clothing or trinkets would not be efficient items to pass out to consumers unless you have an audience that can be almost guaranteed to become future customers.Today, many other nations are adopting the practice of tissue-pack advertising, including countries like the U.S, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This style of marketing takes a little ingenuity and creative design, but results can be astounding. Here are some tips and tricks to establish your very own tissue-paper marketing campaign:

                <p>
                 <strong>Step 1:</strong>
                 Determine what item you will be using for your tissue-pack advertising campaign. Remember, the cost of production and value of the product to the consumer are the most important factors to consider before choosing your item. Decide on a cheap, yet practical item.
                 </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Step 2:</strong>
                  Once you have decided on the item you’ll be handing out consumers, develop and design the graphic that will be printed on the packaging of the product. This advertisement shouldn’t be overly word and easy for the consumer to understand.

                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
                Undergo the production phase. This is when you’ll be printing and producing your products right before they reach your marketers and hired-hands. If you’re intending for your first round or few to be trial runs, make sure not to make too much of your product.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
                 Place your marketers and hired-hands in key locations where your target audience should be. Choose events or locations they are most likely to frequent, including substations, train stations, concerts, plazas, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> Step 5: </strong>
                Research and record feedback from a random selection of people who have taken a free tissue-pack product from your business. Here you better understand your consumer and tailor your product to their wants and needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 6: </strong>
                Refine your tissue-pack product to better conform to your target audience. If people are too confused or unsure of the message your tissue-pack products are trying to send consumers, modify the graphic for easier readability.

              </p>
            <p>
            <strong>  Step 7: </strong> Send your marketers and hired-hands back out into the field and repeat steps 5-6 until your target audiences’ responses are mostly positive.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Guerilla marketing techniques, although quite experimental, can provide highly efficient marketing campaigns at very low margins. Although tissue pack-marketing can be more costly than traditional flyering methods, businesses will find them to be more effective at marketing a brand or product. In the case of an effective tissue-pack product, this increased advertising efficiency would be due to the consumer being under constant exposure to a product that they give a high value towards. In turn, they will associate certain brands with that highly valued tissue-pack product and will therefore value those certain brands more based on association. Tissue-pack advertising will take a relatively little amount of capital to invest into to make a successful marketing campaign. The most important idea to consider in this campaign, is the value of the product to the consumer and the production cost to your business.

              <h3>Tips</h3>
              <p>
                -Choose a product that people find useful. Those products are automatically highly valued by most consumers. -Do not limit your tissue-pack advertising campaign solely on tissue-packages. There are many more products to choose from that could work better on certain target demographics. -Stay away from using costly tissue-pack products in order to minimize your campaign’s marketing costs. There is no need to unnecessarily waste money.
