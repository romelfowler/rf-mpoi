              <p>Undercover marketing, also known as buzz marketing or word-of-mouth
                marketing, is a style of marketing best suited at developing a product’s
                attractiveness and renown with a low-profile method of advertising.
                Imagine you’re at a sports convention and you notice a famous athlete
                sporting a set of trendy activewear from a brand you haven’t really heard of.
                During his conversations surrounded by fans, he continually, but ever so subtly,
                mentions the brand of activewear that he’s wearing, as something that enhances his performance
                or improves his gameplay. Eventually, some of these fans would take note of this new,
                high performing line of sportswear and talk amongst their friends about the brand and
                these friends would talk amongst their friends. What this athlete is accomplishing is
                a form of undercover marketing whereby using a sense of fame and credibility,
                they increase product/brand awareness in a way that does not seem like advertising.
                Undercover marketing is a unique tool that enables a company to increase brand awareness
                in an organic manner without pushing too hard on the potential consumers.
                Here are some tips and tricks to establish your very own undercover marketing campaign:</p>
                <p>
                 <strong>Step 1:</strong>
                 Determine your target audience. Without first understanding who
                 you will be advertising to, you will not be able to develop
                 an effective marketing plan.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Step 2:</strong>
                  Hire someone that can connect with your target audience. This is of high importance,
                  since the person or persons you intend to hire in your undercover marketing campaign
                  should be someone that the target audience can deem credible or authentic.

              <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
                Determine the venue or venues where you will be sending your
                undercover marketer. Make sure that these events have potential
                consumers that have the highest likelihood of becoming a customer for your business.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
                 Develop a plan-of-attack on how your undercover marketer(s)
                 will approach consumers. Make sure that they are not too aggressive
                 in their advertising tactics or else people will suspect that
                 they are representatives from your company and disvalidate their credibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> Step 5: </strong>
                Place your marketers in key events where your target audience
                should be. Choose events or locations they are most likely to
                frequent, including conventions, concerts, parties, venues, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 6: </strong>
                Repeat the process steps 2-4 again, but with different undercover
                marketers. This will prevent people from getting too suspicious of
                your marketers. Remember, once they become aware that these people
                are paid marketers, conversations between the two will not seem as
                organic and your marketer will not advertise your business as effectively.

              </p>
            <p>
            <strong>  Step 7: </strong> Sit back and reap the benefits.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Guerilla marketing techniques, although quite experimental,
                can provide highly efficient marketing campaigns at very low margins.
                Undercover marketing is a very popular style of guerilla marketing
                that invokes an increase in brand awareness by creating organic
                exposure to a product, like a friend telling you about a good movie.
                Undercover marketing capitalizes on the human desire to share common
                interests with friends and acquaintances. People who think they’ve
                found an amazing product or brand on their own will, more often than not,
                go out of their way to spread positive messages on that item or company.
                But if a person feels as if someone or something is trying to sell them a
                product, they will instinctively become defensive. This style of marketing
                prevents consumers from raising their guard by developing organic, casual conversations,
                akin to something you would have with a friend. To have a successful undercover
                marketing campaign, you need to have an enthusiastic marketer to advertise
                your product. The people you choose will determine the effectiveness of this
                type advertising method, so choose wisely, and you will soon be seeing the a sudden
                increase to the outreach of your company.

              <h3>Tips</h3>
              <p>
                -Undercover marketing works well for small companies with small
                advertising budgets or large companies that want to develop brand
                awareness without bombarding the consumer with adverts. -You don’t
                need a celebrity to market your product or brand when using undercover marketing.
                Simply use someone your target consumer can validate as an authentic or
                credible source to gain their information. You can hire enthusiastic marathon
                runners to attend several different running events to market an athletic shoe
                line by developing organic, casual conversations with other runners.
                -The word-of-mouth aspect of undercover marketing is one of the strongest asset
                provided by this marketing technique. People like to hear and interact with
                like-minded individuals in person, rather than someone they see behind a screen.
