                Wild posting advertising involves a rather inexpensive form of marketing
                your business, which can garner massive outreach when you wildly post in
                high traffic or key locations. Traditionally, wild posting advertising calls
                for the plastering of advertisements for your business, typically posters,
                throughout street alleyways, on the sides of buildings, through construction
                site walkways, or any surface where people are likely to traffic.
                This form of guerilla marketing requires relatively low overhead costs,
                since most of the spaces you’ll be placing your postings will typically
                be free of cost. The pitfall to avoid is the legality of where you will be
                posting, since some buildings and locations prohibit the solicitation of
                advertisements on their building walls. Business owners have circumvented
                this problem by replacing their posters on the building walls whenever
                they have been torn down. H ere are some tips and steps to starting your
                astroturf marketing campaign:
              </p>
                <p>
                 <strong>Step 1:</strong>
                 Develop and create the visuals you’ll be posting throughout high
                 traffic areas. Since people will be passing through these areas
                 quickly, consider an eye catching image with large bolded words.
                 Images with too many words will most often be ignored by pedestrians.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Step 2:</strong>
                  Determine the size of your posters. Make it too large, and other
                  business will cover parts of your poster and the message you are
                  trying to send consumers about your business will be lost. The
                  size of your poster can also convey additional meaning and
                  symbolism about your business as it is presented to consumers.

                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
                Now that you have your posters completely created, plan and map out the locations you’ll be setting your wild posting campaign. Some high traffic areas may be better than others for your business. Also consider that the legality of posting on certain types of buildings.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
                Wait a few days to a few weeks and check back in on the locations you set up your wild posting campaign. Determine which areas your advertisements were overwhelmed by other advertisements and areas in which your posters were still in good condition.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> Step 5: </strong>
Plan and map out the locations you’ll be setting your wild posting campaign based on how well your posters marketed your business. These locations can be new locations or old locations that you deemed successful areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 6: </strong>
              Take note of the new business you’ll be getting. You’ve just reached out to a larger audience. So sit back and reap the benefits.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Wild posting advertising is a supplemental marketing technique used to promote businesses in large urban areas. Although you may not reach out to as massive a number of individuals as other guerilla marketing methods, wild posting advertising has very inexpensive overhead costs and requires much less work. The majority of costs come from printing the posters consumers will be viewing during their commute or trip to the store. This style of marketing is best used in tandem with other marketing techniques. Alone, wild posting advertising may not garner impressive results, but every little outlet you decide to market your business will help in the long run to reach out to a larger number of potential customers.
