                  In a world of a rising digital presence in the media market, email advertising serves to spread information about deals and promotions at an unprecedented consistency. Email advertising allows business and brands to keep their consumers and potential new consumers involved and updated with company promotions and news. In this way, consumers will be more aware of the deals offered by a brand and will be more likely to purchase a product from that business. This style of marketing involves more than just aimlessly sending emails to random potential customers, but requires some intense planning and organization. Here are some tips and tricks to setting up your very own email advertising campaign.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
Compile a list of of emails of potential consumers. This can be done by requesting users to join an emailing list. Most users will not willingly join an email list for no reason, so make sure to incentivize people to join this email list. Incentivize subscribing with special offers and discounts not available to those without a subscription.
      </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong>
 Develop a newsletter that you can send out on a monthly or weekly basis. Do not send daily newsletters because it will clutter userâ€™s emails, angering or annoying some, causing them to unsubscribe. This newsletter should contain an update on news within or related to your business and information relevant to the consumer, which includes a deal or coupon.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
(Optional): Develop several advertisements to eventually email to your emailing list. This is not a newsletter so updates on your company are not necessary. These advertisements are designed to further promote your company products and/or services. These advertisements are much easier and quicker to read than the newsletter and provides a quick look into what your company offers. Use these advertisements to promote previously mentioned promotions or to promote new ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
Rinse and repeat steps 1-3 and reap the benefits of an increased traffic to your website.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Starting your own email advertising campaign involves a little research, but when does a marketing campaign not involve research? Start off by developing an emailing list with hundreds, thousands, or millions of users that you can contact by email in order send them promotions and newsletter every once in awhile. Once you have developed an encompassing list, filter the list to include users who would most likely purchase a product in your email promotions or newsletters. These people would be in demographics that are already likely to purchase products similar to your products, such as females are much more likely to buy make up supplies, so targeting females with your emails would be more effective than targeting both males and females. With your email list large enough now, you can begin to develop a weekly or monthly newsletter that updates users on specials, promotions, or news regarding the company. This newsletter will remind users about your brand and encourage them to purchase your products. You can build further on the newsletter by developing additional advertisements with additional promotions and deals to build consumer interest. Make sure not to send advertisements and newsletters too frequently as to annoy certain users, decreasing the amount of people subscribed to your mailing list. Rinse and repeat and reap the benefits.

              <h3>Tips</h3>
              <p>
                -The most important detail to creating a successful email marketing campaign involves developed a targeted email list. People are more likely to purchase a product when they have shown interest in similar types of products. -Email advertising should be used in conjunction with other advertising tactics. Email advertising alone will not provide a large increase in website traffic and requires other techniques working in tandem to provide successful results. -Incentivize users to subscribe to your emailing list. People who join this list voluntarily are already willing to purchase or consider purchasing one of your products.
