                  Although digital media has established a strong presence in the present world, traditional advertising methods like direct mail advertising can still effectively promote a business. Direct mail advertising involves promoting your business by directly mailing posters, business cards, newsletters, brochures or any other form of print advertising to other business, or more commonly, directly to the homes of consumers. Direct mail advertisements have the advantage of being a relatively cheap method of marketing, avoiding a middleman to promote your business i.e. television company or magazine, and allows you to advertise directly to a business office or a consumer’s home. The major disadvantage to direct mail marketing ,though, is the stigma surrounding direct mail advertisements. Most mail not related to bills or official use will often be grouped into a term called “junk mail” and will more often than not, stay unread. Successful direct mail marketing campaigns will utilize advertisements with enough appeal to circumvent being termed as junk mail. This is done by making the graphic extremely appealing or by inserting great deals and promotions to set the graphic apart from the rest of the mail. Some companies have built a business model around direct mail advertising campaigns, such as Penny Saver, and stand as successful companies today. Businesses such as Penny Saver owe a large majority of their direct mail advertising success by creating an easy-to-view collection of direct mails ads with special coupons and deals. Here are some tips and tricks to establishing your very own direct mail advertising campaign.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
Develop a mailing list that consists of individuals and businesses who are most likely notice and acknowledge your advertisement. In order to produce the most tailored list for your business, request demographics of prospective area you’ll advertise in.
      </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong>
Develop graphics for your direct to mail advertisements. These graphics do not necessarily require a coupon to be functioning and effective, but coupons and promotions help differentiate you ad from the other direct to mail papers.                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
Send your advertisements to the homes and business on your mailing list. Adjust the list as need be.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
Continue developing different graphics for your advertisements, making sure to consider the time of year and the current events going on at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 5: </strong>
                Repeat steps 1-4, sit back, and reap the benefits.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Although direct mail advertisements may have the unfortunate reputation of being “junk mail,” these advertisements have their own special place in the modern market. Direct mail advertisements enable businesses to directly advertise to individuals with similar interests and skip the middleman altogether. Take some time to obtain information about the demographics in surrounding areas and take note of the addresses of potential customers. Advertise to individuals that match a demographic that typically shows interest in your brand in order to maximize efficiency. Once you have developed a tailored mailing list, develop (or hire someone to develop) a graphic for your advertisement. This graphic should be simple, informative, and should try to outshine amongst the several other advertisements with eye-catching graphics or a promotion of some sort. Send the advertisements to the target homes and businesses and wait a few weeks to a few months to determine the effectiveness of the ads. Modify the mailing list to include a larger group of people and enhance the graphics accordingly, then sit back and reap the benefits.
