                  Although magazine advertising shows an undeniable similarity to newspaper advertising, magazines can vary much more in content than newspapers, giving room for ads in magazine to be focused towards a more specific target audience. Different magazine names exist because people tend to gravitate towards environments that they find familiar. A person who enjoys fashion will tend to read fashion magazines, and thusly will be more likely to purchase fashion-related products in that magazine. Magazine advertising establishes brand awareness and more effectively allows people to generate associations with brands versus newspaper advertising. It is important to remember though that magazines do not reach out to as many individuals compared to popular newspaper names. This is simply due to that most magazines are tend to target specific audiences rather than appealing to a large populace. Magazines are effective for advertising to specific groups of people rather than to large swaths of the general public. Here are some tips and steps to starting your advertising campaign with a newspaper organization.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
Determine which magazine name you hope to advertise with. Make sure that the magazine aligns with your brand or product you’re trying to promote because that will most effectively increase outreach.
      </p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 2: </strong>
  Get into contact with an advertising or marketing representative for that magazine. Contact information can be typically found by searching the magazine’s online website or by searching in the back of the magazine itself.

</p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
Request all the necessary information, including a media kit. This kit should include pricing, advertisement sizes, and discounts. If the representative does not provide discounts in the media kit, request if any specials are ongoing, the representative will usually provide you with one.
               </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
                Develop, or hire someone to develop, a graphic for the advertisement you hope to place in the magazine. Discounts are not always necessary in a magazine, compared to newspaper advertisements, since magazines can be designed to stylistically represent different organizations and topics. The graphic should be related to the overall theme of the magazine and you should aim for a creative graphic in order to set it apart from the other advertisements in the magazine. Look at other advertisements in the magazine to get some ideas of effective graphics.

                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 5: </strong>
Send in all the information the newspaper you’re working with needs and watch your business grow.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Starting your own magazine advertising campaign involves a little research, but when does a marketing campaign not involve research? Take a look at the prospective magazines the area, making sure to consider national and international options as well, and take note of each magazine’s theme or main focus. Once you have a feeling for which magazine mostly aligns with your brand’s values and ideals, contact an advertising/marketing representative and request some information and a media kit; this is where you can score some serious discounts. After you’ve decided which magazine interests you the most, develop (or hire someone to develop) a graphic for your advertisement. This graphic should be simple, informative, and should offer something of interest to the potential consumer, but this does not necessarily have to be a discount. Consider creating a graphic that is sexually provocative or very visually appealing. Send the graphic to the magazine company and continue this process with several other magazines and reap the benefits.

              <h3>Tips</h3>
              <p>
                -The most important caveat to consider is the magazine name you hope to advertise with. It does not matter if a magazine you’re considering has national coverage if it is unrelated to the brand you are trying to promote. If you own a kitchen supply company, market with a kitchen related magazine rather than a sports magazine. -Magazines advertisements tend to be on the pricey side compared to other forms of advertisements, ranging from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars. Choose the one that works best for you company. A price of an advertisement does not determine that it will be an effective one.
