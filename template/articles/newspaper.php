                  Newspapers have been around for centuries, and advertising in newspapers has been around longer than most other forms of advertising today. Even with competition from other methods of marketing and advertising, newspaper advertising still stands as a very effective marketing tool. These types of ads are designed to run parallel with current events and new stories, encouraging the viewer to associate certain current events with that product. Especially with continuous newspaper stories, stories that continue for days or even weeks later, the reader will often begin to associate that advertisement with the stories within the newspaper. An example of this being news stories on homicides can help market health or security related products (link). Stories in international newspapers also work this way where articles of upcoming events will have related advertisements to promote a business (link) In this way, newspaper advertising helps businesses reach out to more individuals, especially to those in niche markets or to older generation - ages 40+. Although other forms of marketing exist, paper advertising still can run superior in some ways more than others. Here are some tips and steps to starting your advertising campaign with a newspaper organization.

                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
Get into contact with several advertising or marketing representative from local, national, or international newspaper organizations. You want to have several organizations to choose from in order to diversify your options when choosing which newspaper to advertise with.

<p>
  <strong>Step 2: </strong>
Research different newspaper organizations and find which one fits your standards the best. It may be the one within your price range or the one with most popular reviews and best success stories. This involves requesting a media kit if they haven’t sent you one already.
</p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
Review the media kits and all the information you received and determine the newspaper that fits yours needs the best. The media kit will often have special information that the advertising/marketing representative can tend to leave out, intentional or not, like discounts and rebates. If you’re still not satisfied with your options, speak to the advertising/ marketing representative and relay your problems. More often than not, the representative is authorized to provide an additional discount that could help with your final advertising costs.
               </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
Develop, or hire someone to develop i.e. the newspaper organization, an effective graphic that will advertise your company or business. An effective newspaper graphic usually involves a deal or a coupon to incentivize a reader to use your product. This will encourage the reader to search for your deal or coupon time after time.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Starting your own newspaper campaign involves a little research, but when does a marketing campaign not involve research? Take a look at the prospective newspaper organizations in the area and take note of their political agenda. Once you have a feeling for which organization would benefit you the most, contact an advertising/marketing representative and request some information and media kit; this is where you can score some serious discounts. After you’ve decided which organization interests you the most, develop (or hire someone to develop) a graphic for your advertisement. This graphic should be simple, informative, and should offer something of interest to the potential consumer, like a discount. Send the graphic to the organization and reap the benefits.

              <h3>Tips</h3>
              <p>
                -Older generations typically tend to read the paper more than younger generations. The exception being a college newspaper, where a vast majority of the viewers are of a younger denomination. -Pricing for a newspaper graphic is usually determined by the size of graphic, including length and width, and the popularity of the paper. By purchasing several advertising spaces, a newspaper organization will typically provide a frequency discount. There are several discounts, so make sure to keep an eye out for them. -Newspaper advertising is not required by modern standards to successfully promote a business, but it helps target niche groups that normally wouldn’t see your advertisement.
