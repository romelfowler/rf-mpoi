                  With digital media marketing dominating the professional world, an emerging guerilla marketing tactic, Astroturfing, serves to provide an effective marketing service. Astroturfing describes utilizing paid sponsors to promote your business, but these paid sponsors are presented as coming from or associated with grassroots individuals and organizations. Astroturfing is typically accomplished by using bloggers, reviewers, and/or critics to promote your business. Astroturfing can be very effective at manipulating the perspective of the public to your organization’s desired public perception, but given that it is not publicly disclosed that paid sponsors are being used to promote your business; it could open the arena for public scrutiny and backlash. For example, Walmart previously developed a website “Working Families for Wal-Mart” to give the appearance that grassroots organizations were developing in order to support Wal-Mart against unions and there was massive public outcry against the shady marketing tactics of Wal-Mart. In another example, popular websites such as Amazon, will often have gleaming reviews of products paid for by the company selling said product. In this case, the company will receive a boost in sales due to their products having a higher rating, while most users will be unaware that many of the reviews are biased and sometimes paid for. Here are some tips and steps to starting your astroturf marketing campaign.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
                Determine the best group of individuals to represent your business that would benefit you the most in your astroturfing campaign. This would include determining how you want to promote your business, i.e. promoting a product or promoting the business as a whole.

<p>
  <strong>Step 2: </strong>
  Search and contact bloggers, critics, and other individuals who would be interested in an astroturfing campaign. One way to accomplish this is to post a wanted ad for marketers or reviewers on any job listing site. You can also search through blogs found on Twitter, Tumblr, or other sites to find individuals who would be interested in working with you.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
Direct your new bloggers, critics, or reviewers in promoting your business. For bloggers and critics, instruct them to promote your brand without giving off the impression they are paid sponsor. This is important to establish the individual as a reputable and genuine source of information so that their fans will also want to purchase your brand. For reviewers, you may either pay them per review or incentivize a positive review by providing them with a sample product from your brand.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
                Rinse and repeat this process (step 1-3) several times until the desired effect of increased brand awareness is achieved. Bloggers, critics, or reviewers who disclose, even unintentionally, that they are paid sponsors should be dealt with swiftly to mitigate any damages.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Guerilla marketing techniques have gained a large following through how effective these marketing methods have proven to be. Astroturfing holds the spot as one of the most influential styles of guerilla marketing since it taps into other owner’s and entertainer’s fan bases. Astroturfing requires that a strong group of individuals represent a company while at the same time acting as if they are unaffiliated with company itself. Take some time to browse through various bloggers or critics and consider hiring those that mostly align with your brand’s values and ideals. If you plan on using reviewers to boost the rating of your product or brand, simply incentivize writers to provide positive reviews by gifting them with a free product to review or by simply paying them. Hiring the right individuals is the most important step for creating an astroturf marketing campaign. Once you’ve hired the appropriate individuals to represent your brand, direct their actions to give the public the impression that the blogger or critic genuinely loves your product. The perceived genuineness of these bloggers or critics will go miles to influencing their fan base to follow in their steps and purchase your products. Astroturfing walks the line between heavy manipulation and regular advertising and is a rather risky marketing technique, so make sure that the public remains unaware or outright notify to the public about the paid sponsors that were supposedly unaffiliated.

              <h3>Tips</h3>
              <p>
                -Astroturfing is a risky marketing technique. Make sure that the reward greatly outweighs the risk of astroturfing. If there is no need to be secretive about using paid sponsors, then don’t keep it a secret. -“Paying” an individual to review your product does not necessarily entail providing money to receive a review. You can provide them with the product for free, and it has been shown in studies that individuals who receive products for free are much more likely to provide a positive review, even if they don’t necessarily enjoy the product. -When done correctly, astroturfing provides phenomenal results.
