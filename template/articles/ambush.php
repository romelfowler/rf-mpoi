                  The idea of ambush marketing involves creatively promoting your brand while undermining the sponsorship activities of other official sponsors for the event. Think of the last time you saw a sporting event, at home or live, and the camera continually panned over to a group of people all wearing the same eye-catching clothes. Most people would knock this off as a simple coincidence, but in more cases than not, companies paid for these groups to be shown more often than other crowd members in order to promote their business. Businesses use ambush marketing techniques in order to promote their brand using minimal investment while at the same time taking advantage of a competitor’s spot light. Extreme forms of ambush marketing have been banned in many 1st world countries, which include confusing viewers to believe a non-official sponsor was the official sponsor for a sporting event (link), but most moderate forms of ambush marketing still remain legal in the market. Ambush marketing can effectively advertise a brand or product without involving major investments. Here are some tips and tricks to to creating an effective ambush marketing campaign for your business.
