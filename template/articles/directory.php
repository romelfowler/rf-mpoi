                  Although many new forms of advertising available for marketing use today, directory advertising still stands as an effective marketing method in certain niche environments. Directory advertising is described as a form of marketing that utilizes directories, including popular business listings like Yellow Pages or phone indexes set by the city to promote a business or brand. Although directories do not hold as strong of presence they had before the advent of the internet - a few decades ago, niche services can still find themselves benefiting from directory advertisements. Today, directories are typically used for finding home-related services like plumbing, electricity, or AC services, especially by people who are ages 35 and older. The largest benefit this method of advertising remains the long lasting presence of any directory ad. Since directories are not typically updated until the following year, advertisements in these large indexes will not change for a year’s time, ensuring you maximize your outreach for an entire year. Here are some tips and tricks to establishing your very own directory advertising campaign.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
                Search for the directory that would provide the most benefit to your company if you were to advertise with them. When searching through your options, consider the purpose, theme, and outreach of each directory.

      </p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 2: </strong>
Get into contact with a marketing or advertising representative for the prospective directories. Make sure to request a media kit, which should contain a large chunk of necessary information, including background information, prices, and discounts. Ask the representative if there are any promotions or specials going on at the moment in order to get the best discount when placing your advertisements.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
                Develop a graphic for your advertisement. Since your graphic will be competing with other similar companies, make your graphic stand out among the rest of the advertisements. Consumers tend to purchase services from business where they will get the best deal, so place a coupon or discount to maximize the traffic coming to your organization.

               </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
                Rinse and repeat for each year you plan to advertise in a directory. Since the advertising costs occur on a yearly basis, update your graphic to ensure that it is relevant and easily accessible to consumers.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Directory advertisements have their own special place in the modern market. Starting your own directory advertising campaign can drive some serious traffic to your business or brand if you’re in the right niche market, like plumbing, electrical work, carpentry, etc. Take some time to search through the different types of directories; there are several thousand, each containing a tailored set of businesses and individuals in specific or general fields. Once you have a feeling for which directory would be the most beneficial to invest an advertisement with, contact an advertising/marketing representative and request additional information and a media kit; this is where you can score some serious discounts. After you’ve decided which organization interests you the most, develop (or hire someone to develop) a graphic for your advertisement. This graphic should be simple, informative, and should try to outshine amongst the several other advertisements with eye-catching graphics or a promotion of some sort. Send the graphic to the organization and reap the benefits.

              <h3>Tips</h3>
              <p>
                -Directories are most effective for advertising home-related services such as plumbing, electricity, or AC services, etc. -There are more directories than just Yellow Pages. There are thousands of other types of directories designed for trade associations, industrial organizations, government agencies, real estate companies, etc. -Remember that directory advertisements typically last a year - until the next directory edition is printed. They have a very high outreach. -Most young people do not find themselves using print directories and will tend to use modern, online equivalents like Yelp. -Most people who look for ads in a directory are already willing to purchase that product or service. Your directory ad should convince the viewer why your service or product benefits the consumer more. Is it cheaper? Of more quality?
