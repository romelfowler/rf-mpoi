                  In the digital age, display advertising remains one of the most basic yet effective methods of digital marketing. Display advertising involves using a banner on a third-party website, blog, or mobile game to drive traffic to a corporate website and promote brand awareness. Banners are typically either animated or static, presenting a thought-provoking image or a deal or promotion in order to grab the attention of the masses. In order to develop the most effective display advertisement, cookies are typically utilized in order to determine demographics, location, and interest of a user. These cookies can be analyzed a step further using a clicker analysis program in order to determine a user’s online behavior, such as the frequency they visit certain sites, like sports or clothing websites. Effective display advertisements will not target everyone who enters the website or starts the game, but will display different styles or types of advertisements based on the viewer’s preferences and tastes. Presenting non-targeted ads to random individuals will often have the opposite effect of increasing brand awareness and will simply cause users to become annoyed, greatly reducing the effectiveness of your banner ads. Here are some tips and tricks to establishing your very own display advertising campaign.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
                Search through several different websites, including blogs, to determine the general goals of these websites and the types of audiences that view their websites. This is important in determining what type of viewers will notice your display ads. The most receptive viewer is one that is proven to have recently viewed similar products and services to your brand.

      </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong>
Contact representatives from these websites in order to request a media kit or similar document. This media kit should contain all the necessary information to the start your display ad campaign with the prospective company, including prices, time length of an advertisement, and advertising promotions. If they do not mention discounts, then ask. They will usually provide.
                <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
                Develop or hire someone to develop graphics for your display ads. This graphic does not necessarily need a coupon or discount. Display ads can be just effective without a coupon, if the graphic used for the ad piques the interest of the user in a unique way. This can be accomplished by making the graphic eye-appealing, sexually provocative, or thought provoking.

                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
                Wait a month or two to start seeing results. If there is noticeable increase in your website traffic, then it is a success. If no effect is observed, repeat steps 1-3 and develop more targeted or visually appealing advertisements.

                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 5: </strong>
                Sit back and reap the benefits!

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Starting your own display advertising campaign involves a little research, but when does a marketing campaign not involve research? Search through the different websites that mostly align with your brand’s values and ideals. Once you have a feeling about which websites would benefit you the most, contact an advertising/marketing representative and request some information and a media kit; this is where you can score some serious discounts. After you’ve decided which organization interests you the most, develop (or hire someone to develop) a graphic for your advertisement. This graphic should be simple, informative, and should offer something of interest to the potential consumer, like a discount. Send the graphic to the organization and reap the benefits.

              <h3>Tips</h3>
              <p>
                -The cost of a display will depend on the size of the banner, but will also vary from site to site. A popular website with a few millions of views per month will cost more to present a display ad versus website with hundreds of thousands of views per month. -Make sure to utilize cookies to ensure that you present your ads to the most relevant groups of people. People who are already interested in products similar to your brand will already be more willing to view the ad rather than someone with no interest. -It has been shown that banner ads with busty, risque women will have more clicks than other ads without sexually provocative women. Sex sells.
