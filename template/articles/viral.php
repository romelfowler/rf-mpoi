                Although Viral Marketing sounds like the process of marketing and selling viruses, in actuality, this style of marketing allows brands and businesses to garner massive support and outreach by taking an approach similar to word-of-mouth tactics. Viral marketing can involve developing a video, article, or topic that can exponentially gain popularity in a short amount of time by an unforeseen randomness, though most viral marketing techniques involve a much more structure path to gaining popularity. A famous example of viral marketing is the rise in popularity of Dumb Ways to Die: a PSA by the Metro Trains of Melbourne, Australia. The video gained a massive following by utilizing three concepts that many young people find appealing, a cute, catchy, and violent theme. This combination of ideas encouraged people to share the content and allow the video to become an overnight success. Viral marketing requires that you, as the marketer, develop content that a target demographic would be willing to share with other like-minded individuals. There is no guaranteed way to induce a video, article, or concept to become viral, but there are several steps that can be followed in order to best produce viral content. Here are some tips and tricks to produce your very own viral marketing campaign.              </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
                Identify the target demographic for a product and determine what this target demographic deems the most valuable in most products. Viral marketing is a customer-focused approach that relies on understanding what values of products certain demographics state as important.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong>
                Develop content that your target audience would be willing to share with like minded individuals. This is the most important step to viral marketing. Without compelling you target audience to share and spread your content, then no one will ever hear about your marketing campaign.

                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
                Continually update that content to cater to your target audience’s desires and wants. The work doesn’t stop at the first piece of viral content you create. The best viral marketing campaigns interact with their audience to develop more interest for more content created by that company.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
                Repeat Steps 1-3 for different demographics, observing what each demographic states as an important value they see in products.
                </p>

                <strong>Step 5: </strong>
Rinse and repeat and reap the benefits.

Modify your content accordingly, rinse and repeat, and reap the benefits.
