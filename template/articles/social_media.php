                  With technology rapidly being integrated into our daily lives, social media now dominates a massive percentage of people’s daily lives in the present world; a business with quality social media profiles and posts is a successful one. Each social media market available today consists of largely varied demographics, making each market a different environment that requires different advertising approaches in order to effectively promote a business. To name a few popular social media applications: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat and Pinterest.

                <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
Determine which social media application you intend to promote your business with. Utilizing several different applications at the same time can maximize the reach of your social media advertising campaigns. Some applications are better for different forms of advertisement than others, such as Instagram would much better at showing off different brand-named products than Twitter or LinkedIn.
      </p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 2: </strong>
Once you’ve chosen which applications you intend to work with, develop a plan of action. Determine the content of the posts you’ll be creating, the frequency of your postings, and the audience you intend to market to.
</p>

                <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
                Establish and develop fairly consistent posts for each social media application under your brand name. These posts should consist of promotions, updates to your business, and other relevant information to consumers.

               </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
 (Optional): Once you’ve established a consistent repertoire for your posts, you can attempt to branch out and reach out to more potential consumers by developing social media posts that include the company’s opinion on certain current events and topics. If there was a mass shooting in the area, then you could create a post sending your condolences to the victims and how you will be helping support them. This shows the public you company cares about relevant events and not just about increasing the cash flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Step 5: </strong>
Rinse and repeat (Steps 1-4) and watch your website traffic skyrocket.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Starting your own social media advertising campaign involves a little research, but when does a marketing campaign not involve research? Take some time to browse through the different social media applications and utilize the ones that could benefit your brand or organization the most. Trying to hire the best employees? Try LinkedIn. Trying to market mostly to the young, trendy adults in the U.S.? Try Instagram. The best approach involves utilizing several different forms of social media to maximize your business's outreach. Once you’ve established which social media applications you intend to use to market your brand, then you can start considering the bulk of the work in social media marketing, posting on social media. Your posts should be fairly consistent, occurring every few days or on a weekly basis. The material on each post will not always be some form of advertisement, but can also be company opinions or responses to comments. Positive opinions or witty responses will garner massive attention, increasing brand awareness for your organization. Play around with the different responses you can provide to the public, including varying tonality and content of these comments, to determine the most effective method of presentation. Also keep in mind maintaining genuineness. People tend to dislike liars or people who skew the truth. Once you’ve established a fairly consistent and positively-received repertoire, continue posting new content and reap the benefits of a massive increase in site traffic and brand awareness.
