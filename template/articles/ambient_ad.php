                Ambient marketing describes the process of establishing brand awareness without necessarily pushing for its product. Businesses who employ this method of advertisement typically establish brand awareness by associating similar every day objects with one of their products. Such an example would include shaping the trailer of a big rig into other rectangular products or by using marine life to advertise large companies. Ambient marketing avoids the in-your-face style of marketing that most other advertising methods resort to, and instead aims to encourage brand awareness by constantly showing that brand or product, allowing viewers to develop subconscious associations with the brand image and other similar looking objects. Ambient marketing is an important advertising tool that is designed to work on the curiosity of the human mind and allows the consumer to seek the advertisement rather than have the advertisement seek the consumer. It is a technique that can effectively establish brand awareness by lowering the guards of consumers to show you are not trying to simply sell them a product, but an idea. Here are some tips and tricks to establishing your very own ambient marketing campaign.

              <p>
               <strong>Step 1:</strong>
Imagine the different objects that can be made to look like your product or remind consumers of your product/brand. Unfamiliar shapes like the rotating luggage carrier found at airports could be transformed into a giant roulette table or a deck of cards. The more creative the better.              <p>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong>
Determine the best location to set up your graphic or visual. This location should be somewhere with a large amount of traffic so that people will notice the graphic. You should also consider the demographics of people who visit those areas frequently. For example, creating an ambient marketing visual promoting fishery would be more effectively placed near a grocery store than at a skateshop.
              <p>
                <strong>Step 3: </strong>
Develop and establish your visual at the desired location(s). An effective ambient marketing graphic or sculpture will not need to be explained or announced to the public. Instead an effective visual will be able to speak for itself.              <p>
                <strong>Step 4: </strong>
Sit back and reap the benefits of an increased awareness to your business.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Guerilla marketing techniques, although quite experimental, can provide phenomenal results when done right. Ambient marketing holds the spot as a very influential style of guerilla marketing that intends to induce genuine curiosity and interest in a brand, increasing business awareness. Unlike many other forms of guerilla marketing, ambient marketing simply requires a visual or graphic to promote a brand or business. The caveat though, is that this graphic or visual should be creative, thought-provoking, and should utilize the surroundings of the environment in order to develop a cohesive and identifiable image. In order to create an effective visual for your ambient marketing campaign, it helps to observe your surroundings or several images where everyday objects can be converted into works of art. This can be something as a simple as a large cylindrical structure, like a water tower, that could be painted to resemble a cake and market a cake or bakery company. Since ambient marketing has very few requirements, the location and art structure are the most important details in constructing a successful campaign. Search through different forms of ambient marketing online and this will help give you a better idea of effective ambient marketing images.
